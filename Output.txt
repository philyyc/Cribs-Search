SECTION A 
(a) 
The two thin-walled cross-sections shown in Fig. lea) are a square and a 
crucifonn of the same exterior dimensions. Show that the wall thickness of the crucifonn 
must be 2 V2 times that of 
the box section for their stiffness in bending about the indicated 
axis to be equal. Assume that both cross-sections are made from the same material and 
that the wall thicknesses are uniform. 
[4] 
(b) 
Two thin-walled tubes have uniform cross-sections of a square with the side­
length L and an equilateral triangle with the base-length Wand both have wall thickness t. 
Find the ratio of their torsion constants. 
[8] 
(c) 
The cross-section of a tube is shown in Fig. 1 
(b). It comprises four equal thin­
walled semi-circular segments of wall thickness t connected to each other on their ends at 
the corners of an imaginary square of side length L. The Young's and shear moduli of the 
tube are E and G, respectively. Calculate the torsional stiffness and the bending stiffness 
(using the Mechanics Data Book or otherwise) about the horizontal symmetry axis.

(a) 
The upright cantilever in Fig. 2(a) has length L and is subjected to a transverse 
distributed load wx/L, where x is the axial distance from the tip. Using virtual work, or 
otherwise, show that the transverse deflection of the tip 8 is given by

where EI is the linear elastic bending stiffness. 
[6] 
(b) 
The elastic frame in Fig. 2(b) consists of one beam and two built-in columns. 
The beam and columns have the same bending stiffness EI, pins connect the columns to 
the beam, and the beam is continuous along its length. The beam carries a uniform loading 
WI. A linearly varying distributed load of maximum value w2 is applied transversely to 
one of the columns.

A thin-walled, circlIlar cylinder of radius R = 1 
m and uniform wall thickness

3 mm has closed ends. It is subjected to an internal gauge pressure p = 250 kPa and 
an axial torque T = 600kNm. 
(a) 
Calculate the shear stress and the components of stress in the axial and hoop­
wise directions. Assume that the through-thickness component of stress is zero. 
[5] 
(b) 
Sketch the three-dimensional set of Mohr's circ 
les for the state of 
stress found 
in (a) and determine the size of the largest shear stress and its direction by indicating an 
appropriate sequence of rotations of the original coordinate axes.

(c) 
If the original axial stress, hoop-wise stress and shear stress are a /2, a and 
'f, respectively, show that yield according to the von Mises criterion is satisfied when

Figure 3(a) shows the cross-section of a long foundation slab used to support a 
building. The slab is of width b and is designed to carry a line load P (force per unit 
length into the page). The ground may be considered as a rigid-perfectly plastic material 
with a yield stress in shear k. 
(a) 
Initially consider the slab to be rigid. By using the slip-circle mechanism 
shown in Fig. 3(b), where rotation takes place about point C, show that an upper-bound 
estimate of the line load at collapse is given by P = 2nkb. 
[6] 
(b) 
There is concern that the foundation slab may also fail. Consider that the slab 
is a rigid-perfectly plastic plate with plastic moment per unit length m. Using the two­
slip-circle mechanism shown in Fig. 3(c), where a plastic hinge forms along the slab at B, 
find another upper-bound estimate of the line load at collapse. 
[8] 
(c) 
If the slab has thickness t and is made of rigid-perfectly plastic material with 
a yield stress in shear ck, determine the required thickness of the slab to ensure that slab 
failure does not occur in the failure mode shown in Fig. 3(c).

Figure 4 shows a portal frame with a fully plastic moment M 
p , carrying a downward 
load 2W distributed uniformly across the beam, and a horizontal point load W acting at 
the mid-height of the shorter column. The frame is rigidly connected to the foundations. 
(a) 
Sketch four reasonable collapse mechanisms where plastic hinges occur at 
some subset of the six points marked A-F. For each mechanism, show clearly where 
plastic hinges have formed. 
[6] 
(b) 
Find an upper-bound estimate of the collapse load for each of the mechanisms 
sketched in (a), making the assumption that any hinge at 0 occurs in the centre of the 
beam. 
[7] 
(c) 
By considering that the hinge at 0 no longer has to occur in the centre of 
the beam, find an optimal upper-bound estimate of the collapse load that improves (even 
marginally) upon those found in (b).

Figure 5 shows a universal beam UB356 x 127 x39 which is continuous over two 
8 m spans. The structure is designed to carry two 100 kN point loads, one at the centre of 
each span. The beam is made of structural steel with a yield stress of 355 MPa.
